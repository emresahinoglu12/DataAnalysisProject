## 📖 Project Overview

This project applies the full data-science pipeline to a real-world cinema ticket-sales dataset:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
4. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**  
5. **Predictive Modeling** (Logistic Regression)  
6. **Customer Segmentation** (K-Means Clustering)  
7. **Artifact Generation** (cleaned CSV, model pickles, visualizations)  

The goal is to understand customer demographics, seating and genre preferences, pricing trends, and factors influencing repeat visits—yielding actionable insights for marketing and retention. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🔍 Motivation

- **Optimize Pricing & Seating**: Identify which seat types and price points resonate with different age groups.  
- **Improve Retention**: Understand what drives a customer to purchase again.  
- **Targeted Marketing**: Discover genre and demographic segments for personalized campaigns.

## 📂 Data Source

- **Raw Data**: `data/cinema_hall_ticket_sales.csv`  
- **Features**:
  - `ticket_id` (unique sale)
  - `age`
  - `ticket_price`
  - `movie_genre`
  - `seat_type`  
  - `number_of_person` (`Alone` ⇒ 1)
  - `purchase_again` (`Yes`/`No` ⇒ 1/0)

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Setup

1. **Clone repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd DataAnalysisProject


Create & activate virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
# or venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


🚀 Usage
1. Run full pipeline
This executes cleaning, EDA chart generation, statistical tests, model training, clustering, and saves all artifacts.

python main.py


2. View interactive EDA
Auto-generate or re-generate the notebook:

python generate_eda_analysis.py


Then launch Jupyter:

jupyter notebook


Open notebooks/eda_analysis.ipynb, run all cells, and view inline charts.







🧰 Methodology
Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Standardize column names, convert “Alone” → 1, map Yes/No to 1/0

Compute revenue, price_per_person, age_group, weekday/weekend flags

Exploratory Data Analysis

Distributions (age, price by seat)

Genre counts & revenue

Repeat-purchase rates by age group

Correlation heatmap & weekly sales trends

Statistical Tests

Chi-square: Premium seat preference among >40 vs ≤40

T-test: Repeat-purchase rate for 18–35 vs others

ANOVA: Ticket-price differences across genres

Predictive Modeling

Logistic Regression pipeline (scaling + one-hot encoding)

Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, classification report, confusion matrix

Customer Segmentation

K-Means clustering on numeric features

Elbow & silhouette methods to select k

Profiling cluster centroids for targeted strategies

📈 Key Findings
Missing Data: None (all columns complete).

Hypotheses: No statistically significant support for seat preference by age >40 or higher repeat rates in 18–35.

Pricing & Seating: Premium/VIP seats command higher prices but aren’t strongly age-dependent.

Genre Popularity: Comedy and Drama top both sales and revenue.

Repeat Purchases: Highest among 36–50 age group, not the youngest.

Segments: Distinct clusters emerged by age, spend, and group size—informing personalized offers.

🚧 Limitations & Future Work
Data Gaps: No showtimes, ratings, or promotional flags.

External Factors: Holiday/seasonality and social media sentiment not incorporated.

Next Steps:

Enrich with external datasets (e.g. weather, reviews).

Build advanced retention models (e.g. tree-based).

Deploy dashboard for real-time monitoring.
